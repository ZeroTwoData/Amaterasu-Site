# Amaterasu Site
Website I developed w/ HTML5, CSS3, Javascript

This responsive website was developed to mimick a company that sells PC hardware components as well as Pre-Built PC's.

The website only works on the "front-end" not the "back-end (cart/search/contact form functions do not submit info)."

Looking forward to improving this website my implementing back-end code. 

Please provide any comments/suggestions so as to improve this site! Thank you ðŸ˜‰!

P.S. The website is hosted by Github pages (in other words you can view the website clicking on the link under the header "Environment" on the right hand side of the screen).
