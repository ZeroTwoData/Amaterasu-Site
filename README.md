# Amaterasu Site
Website I developed w/ HTML5, CSS3, Javascript

This responsive website was developed to mimic a company that sells PC hardware components as well as Pre-Built PC's.

The website only works on the "front-end" not the "back-end (this means that the cart/search/contact_form functions do not submit info)."

Looking forward to improving this website my implementing back-end code in the future. 

Please provide any comments/suggestions so as to improve this site! Thank you ðŸ˜‰!

P.S. The website is hosted by Github pages (in other words you can view the website clicking on the link "github-pages" under the header "Environments" on the right hand side of the screen).
