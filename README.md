# AmaterasuSite
Website I developed w/ HTML5, CSS3, Javascript

This responsive website was developed to mimick a company that sells PC hardware components as well as Pre-Built PC's.

The website only works on the "front-end" not the "back-end (cart/search/contact form functions do not submit info)."

Looking forward to improving this website my implementing back-end code. 

Please provide any comments/suggestions so as to improve this site! Thank you ðŸ˜‰!
